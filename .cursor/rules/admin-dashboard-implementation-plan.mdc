 # Administrator Dashboard Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the development roadmap for the Administrator Dashboard component of the Radix Incentives Campaign Platform. The Admin Dashboard will enable campaign managers to configure campaign parameters, monitor performance, manage users, and generate reports.

## UI
- Always use shadcn for UI components
- Use 21 dev mcp for creating UI elements

## Project directory
- ./apps/admin/**

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Structure & Authentication (2 weeks)

#### Database Schema Extension

- Implement the following schema in Drizzle ORM:
  - `seasonConfig` - Season rules, parameters, and versioning
  - `adminUsers` - Admin user accounts and permissions
  - `adminLogs` - Audit trail for admin actions
  - `reportTemplates` - Templates for generating reports

#### Authentication System

- Implement admin-specific authentication
- Create role-based access control (RBAC)
- Set up admin session management
- Develop audit logging for administrative actions

#### Basic Page Structure

- Set up Next.js app router structure:
  - `/admin` - Main admin dashboard
  - `/admin/campaign` - Campaign configuration
  - `/admin/analytics` - Analytics dashboard
  - `/admin/users` - User management
  - `/admin/reports` - Reporting

### Phase 2: Campaign Configuration Module (2 weeks)

#### Admin API Extension

- Extend tRPC API routes for:
  - Campaign rule management
  - Configuration version control
  - Rule deployment and activation
  - Rule validation

#### Performance Optimization

- Optimize queries for large datasets
- Implement data pre-aggregation
- Create materialized views for common queries
- Set up background processing for intensive calculations

### Phase 4: User Management System (2 weeks)

#### User Search & Filtering

- Implement advanced user search functionality
- Create activity filtering by type, date, and value
- Develop user profile detail view
- Build account linking visualization

#### Account Management

- Create account exclusion functionality
- Implement manual points adjustment tools
- Develop account history viewer
- Build multi-account relationship visualization

### Phase 5: Reporting System & Final Polish (2 weeks)

#### Final Polish

- Performance optimization for all admin interfaces
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add detailed activity logging
- Create admin documentation

#### Deployment Preparation

- Set up staging environment
- Implement feature flags for phased rollout
- Create migration plan for production deployment
- Develop rollback procedures

## Technical Considerations

### Performance

- Use server-side rendering for data-heavy admin pages
- Implement efficient querying patterns for large datasets
- Use React Query for data fetching and caching
- Set up background workers for intensive operations

## Dependencies

- Next.js for frontend framework
- tRPC for type-safe API
- Drizzle ORM for database management
- Bull MQ for background jobs
- Recharts for data visualization
- React Table for data grid components
- Tailwind CSS, Shadcn, and Radix UI for components
