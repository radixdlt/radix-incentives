# Project outline

**Executive Overview**
The Radix Incentives Campaign is intended to enhance significant and sustained on-chain economic activities, leveraging insights from successful blockchain incentive campaigns such as Sonic and HyperLiquid.

The strategic intent behind this campaign is clear: stimulate substantial, economically significant, diversified user actions on the Radix network, promoting meaningful user retention, deeper liquidity pools, higher transaction volumes, and overall network robustness.

**Detailed Strategic Objectives**
Primary Goal: 
- Foster economically meaningful on-chain activity that directly contributes to increased liquidity, trading volumes, and ecosystem utilization.

Secondary Goals:
- Improve retention rates among current Radix users.
- Attract new users and capital to the Radix network through compelling incentives and clear engagement pathways.
- Create lasting network effects, translating short-term incentives into long-term user commitments.

**Campaign Structure**

**Duration and Phases:**
- Each incentive season spans 12 weeks, facilitating rapid iteration and adjustments. Points are calculated on a weekly basis, retrospectively, so that adjustments can be made. every week
- Seasons progressively reduce reward allocation to transition from incentive-driven participation toward organic network adoption.

**Budget and Allocation:**
- Total campaign budget of 1 Billion XRD, strategically distributed across multiple seasons.
- Allocation progressively decreases per season, reinforcing sustainability and minimizing market dilution risk.
- Proposed rate:
  - 200m Season 0
  - 250m Season 1
  - 200m Season 2
  - 150m Season 3
  - 100m Season 4
  - 100m Season 5

## Eligibility, Participation, and Multipliers

**Participation Criteria:**
- Participants must maintain a minimum holding of $50 worth of XRD.
- Eligibility ensures a base level of commitment and economic engagement within Radix’s ecosystem.

**Multiplier Structure:**
- Multipliers incentivize substantial and consistent holdings, following an S-curve pattern:
  - Initial significant multiplier uplift occurs from $5,000 to $100,000 XRD holdings.
  - Above $100,000, incremental multiplier gains diminish significantly, ensuring balanced incentives without undue concentration.
  - Maximum multiplier capped at 3x, awarded to the top 10% of XRD holders.

## Points System and Indicators of Success

To align incentives with Radix’s strategic priorities, points are weighted according to the economic significance and desired network behaviors:

**High Priority Activities (Highest Points):**
- Trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), including perpetual markets.
- Engaging with lending and borrowing protocols using stablecoins (xUSDC, xUSDT), blue-chip volatiles (xBTC, xETH), and native XRD (maybe).
- Liquidity provision on all dApps with stables, blue-chip volatiles, and maybe Radix-native assets.

**Moderate Priority Activities:**
- Trading or liquidity provisioning specifically for Radix-native tokens.
- Low Priority Activities (Minimal Rewards):
- NFT holding, trading, and listing.
- Token minting and holding specific tokens.
- Cross-dApp interactions and first-time dApp usage.

**Points Allocation Methodology** 
Decision - multiple options here:
1: Hybrid Absolute and Percentile Approach
Users earn absolute points based on activity volume and economic significance.
A secondary percentile-based multiplier rewards users relative to overall weekly ecosystem activity, fostering balanced user engagement across wallet sizes.

2: Percentile Approach per activity
Users earn "weekly points" for each activity. At the end of each week, these are converted to "season points" based on which percentile the account was in for activity in that category. Season points are multiplied by the bonus from a user's XRD/LSUs/LSULP. 

**Dynamic Adjustments:**
  Weekly adjustments to point allocations address shifting ecosystem priorities, ensuring maximum responsiveness and alignment with strategic goals. If exploitation is found, activity can be downrated, excluded, or other activity updated to compensate. 

**Anti-Farming and Sustainability Measures**
Robust mechanisms to prevent exploitative behavior and farming:
- Minimum holdings requirement ($50 XRD).
- Transaction fees inherently discourage low-value farming transactions.
- Diversified activity weighting prioritizes holistic ecosystem engagement.
- Retrospective adjustments to points further mitigate potential exploitation.
- (maybe) Potentially a minimum USD value for DEX transactions

**Transparency, Communication, and Measurement**
- Weekly comprehensive reports on user activities, points distribution, and overall leaderboard standings.
  - Needs to be in the frontend. Users need to be able to use RadixConnect with multiple accounts for their bonus and activity rather than splitting users. 
- Open, transparent engagement with community feedback loops and iterative improvements based on data insights.
- Final XRD rewards from Season points TBC; again, option for absolute mapping or percentile.
