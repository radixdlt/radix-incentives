# Points categories

**Overview**

- XRD/LSUs (or direct derivatives) = 1-3x multiplier on season points

- Passive Points (e.g add liquidity on DEX/Lending/Perps/ or hold whitelist asset/NFT) = weekly points per activity (time-weighted average)

- Active Points (e.g DEX Trading, NFTs, borrowing) = weekly points per activity (higher than passive)

- Each week, your score on each activity for passive points and active points = what percentile you are for that “pool” of season points, higher percentile equates to a higher number of fixed season points. When user earns season points, these are multiplied by their XRD multiplier.
