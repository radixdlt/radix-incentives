# Product Development Overview

**User Tracking Infrastructure:**
- Develop or integrate advanced tracking capabilities for accurate activity measurement and points accrual.
- Enable automated, reliable weekly ranking and percentile scoring.

**Points Calculation Engine:**
- Clearly defined and customizable formulas for each activity and how points are calculated.
- Flexible and dynamic capability to accommodate weekly adjustments and retrospective recalibrations.

**Multiplier Mechanism Implementation:**
- Accurately implement the S-curve multiplier mechanism for holding XRD/LSUs/LSULP etc, clearly reflecting tiers and diminishing returns. Could this look backwards to ensure the account(s) must have held these assets for a period of time before earning the multiplier (to avoid account splitting of whales)
- Provide users real-time visibility on their current multiplier and relative standing.

**Anti-Farming Controls:**
- Embed minimum holdings requirement validations.
- Implement dynamic, fee-based transaction evaluation to discourage repetitive low-value activities. (potentially also look at the USD value of assets in a transaction?)
- Develop retrospective adjustment processes to swiftly address exploitation attempts.

**Dashboard and Reporting Tools:**
- User-friendly, informative dashboards detailing points distributions, rankings, and engagement insights.
- Ability to link multiple accounts via Radix connect to a single “user” on the dashboard. This way users who have large amounts of XRD/LSU on cold wallets or use multiple accounts for activity earn points on all accounts. 

**Product Development Roadmap and Next Steps:**
- Immediate focus on analytics and tracking integration or development.
- Finalize validation of points allocation and multiplier logic.
- Dashboard prototyping and internal testing of scoring mechanisms before wider release.
- Can also use historic data for Season 0 that will run from Babylon launch to June 2025.
