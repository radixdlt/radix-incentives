## How to get USD value of WEFT w assets?

1. Get the underlying resource amount. It's can be obtain by multiplying the w2-XRD amount by a ratio available in lending pool state. SDK available [@weft-finance/toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@weft-finance/toolkit)
2. Use price source of XRD (We use Pythagorismes Network) for XRD price in USD

> Atoumbre: The class you need is LendingPool (in sdk). It as all methods required for the info you are looking for

## Implementation Options

Tracking the Time-Weighted Average (TWA) USD value supplied requires knowing the user's supplied balance over the week. Two primary approaches are considered, depending on infrastructure:

---

### Option 1: Real-time Monitoring (Requires Transaction Monitor)

This approach relies on a Transaction Monitoring System to detect deposit/withdrawal events related to recognized lending protocols involving XRD/LSU in near real-time.

#### Granularity Discussion (Real-time)

1.  **Stage 1 (Event Recording):** Triggered per relevant transaction (deposit/withdraw). Validate the event, identify user, asset, amount, protocol, and timestamp. Store these event details.
2.  **Stage 2 (Weekly TWA & Points Allocation):** Triggered weekly after the week ends. Fetches a start-of-week snapshot of supplied balances, applies the recorded events from Stage 1 to reconstruct the balance timeline for each user/protocol/asset, calculates the TWA USD supplied, checks minimums, aggregates network TWA, and distributes the points pool proportionally.

**Decision (for this option):** Adopt the **two-stage, event-recording approach**. Stage 1 captures validated events, Stage 2 performs the weekly TWA calculation and point allocation.

#### Stage 1: Processing Flow (BullMQ Job per Lending Transaction Event)

_(Triggered by the Transaction Monitor when a potential Lend/Withdraw transaction for XRD/LSU at a recognized protocol is detected)_

1.  **Initialization & Data Fetching:**

    - Receive job: `{ transactionId }` (or full transaction data).
    - Fetch full transaction details if needed. Extract `timestamp`, involved addresses, manifest, receipt.
    - Determine `weekId` from `timestamp`.
    - Fetch `Activity` rules for 3.1 (`recognized_protocols`, `lsu_addresses`, `min_lent_value`).

2.  **Transaction Analysis (Lend/Withdraw Event Detection & Validation):**

    - Parse manifest/receipt to identify specific method calls or events indicating a deposit (lend) or withdrawal of XRD or recognized LSUs to/from a `recognized_protocol` component.
    - Determine the `asset_address` (XRD or specific LSU) and `amount` involved.
    - Identify the user `accountAddress` performing the action.
    - Fetch associated `userId` and check exclusion status. Stop if excluded/not found.
    - Determine the `eventType` ('LEND' or 'WITHDRAW').

3.  **Store Event Data:**

    - Store the validated event details in a dedicated table (e.g., `UserLendingEvents`). Include `userId`, `activityId` (3.1), `weekId`, `transactionId`, `protocolAddress`, `assetAddress`, `amount`, `eventType`, and `timestamp`.

    ```sql
    -- Example: UserLendingEvents Table
    CREATE TABLE UserLendingEvents (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
      userId VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL REFERENCES Users(id),
      activityId UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES Activity(id),
      weekId UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES Week(id),
      transactionId UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES Transaction(id), -- Assumes Transaction table populated by Monitor
      protocolAddress VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      assetAddress VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      amount DECIMAL(36, 18) NOT NULL, -- Use appropriate precision
      eventType VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL, -- 'LEND' or 'WITHDRAW'
      eventTimestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
      createdAt TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
      UNIQUE (transactionId, protocolAddress, assetAddress, eventType, amount) -- Basic idempotency
    );
    ```

4.  **Job Finalization:**
    - Log success (event type, amount stored). Acknowledge job completion.

#### Stage 2: Processing Flow (BullMQ Job - Weekly TWA & Points Allocation)

_(Triggered after a week ends)_

1.  **Initialization & Data Fetching:**

    - Receive job: `{ activityId, weekId }` (activityId = 3.1).
    - Fetch `Activity` rules (3.1). Fetch `ActivityWeek` record for `pointsPool`.
    - Fetch end-of-week USD prices for XRD and relevant LSUs (Oracle/Cache).
    - Fetch list of participating `userIds`.

2.  **Calculate TWA per User:**

    - For each `userId`:
      a. Fetch start-of-week supplied balances for XRD/LSUs across all recognized protocols for this user (Requires a snapshot mechanism or query capability).
      b. Fetch all `UserLendingEvents` for this `userId`, `activityId`, and `weekId`, ordered by `eventTimestamp`.
      c. Reconstruct the supplied balance timeline for XRD and each LSU within the week by applying the events to the starting balances.
      d. Calculate TWA balance for XRD and each LSU based on the timeline.
      e. Calculate `user_twa_usd_supplied = (TWA_XRD * price_XRD) + sum(TWA_LSUs * price_LSUs)`.
      f. **Minimum Value Check:** Retrieve `min_lent_value` from rules. If `user_twa_usd_supplied < min_lent_value`, set `user_twa_usd_supplied = 0`.
      g. Store this `user_twa_usd_supplied` value temporarily associated with the `userId`.

3.  **Aggregate Network TWA & Allocate Points:**

    - Sum all positive `user_twa_usd_supplied` values across all users -> `total_network_twa_supplied`.
    - If `total_network_twa_supplied > 0` and `pointsPool > 0`:
      - For each user with `user_twa_usd_supplied > 0`: `account_points = (user_twa_usd_supplied / total_network_twa_supplied) * pointsPool`.
      - Store `account_points` temporarily per `userId`.
    - Else, no points allocated.

4.  **Store Final Points in UserWeeklyPoints:**

    - For each `userId` with points:
      - Find/create `UserWeeklyPoints` record (`userId`, `weekId`).
      - **Atomically** update `activityPoints` JSON: `{ ..., 3.1: account_points, ... }`.
      - **Atomically** increment `basePoints` by `account_points`.

5.  **Job Finalization & Cleanup:**
    - Log success. Optionally cleanup `UserLendingEvents` for the processed week. Acknowledge job completion.

#### Dependencies (Real-time)

- **Transaction Monitoring System**
- Snapshot mechanism/query for start-of-week supplied balances
- BullMQ Client/Worker
- Radix Gateway SDK Client (likely used by monitor)
- Price Oracle Client
- Database Client

#### Database Interactions (Real-time - Stage 1)

- **Read:** `Transaction`, `Activity`, `UserAccount`
- **Write:** `UserLendingEvents` table

#### Database Interactions (Real-time - Stage 2)

- **Read:** `Activity`, `ActivityWeek`, `UserLendingEvents`, Start-of-week balance data
- **Read/Write/Update:** `UserWeeklyPoints` (Atomic updates)
- **Delete:** `UserLendingEvents` (Optional cleanup)

#### Error Handling (Real-time)

- Stage 1: Handle parsing errors, missing data, DB errors. Ensure basic idempotency.
- Stage 2: Handle missing start-of-week data, TWA calculation errors, aggregation failures, atomic update errors. Implement retries.

#### Considerations (Real-time)

- **Start-of-Week Balance:** Requires a reliable way to get the supplied balance snapshot at the beginning of the week.
- **Complexity:** TWA calculation in Stage 2 can be complex.

---

### Option 2: Weekly Batch Processing

This approach queries the Radix Gateway for the entire week's relevant lending transactions after the week ends.

#### Granularity Discussion (Batch)

1.  **Stage 1 (Batch TWA Calculation):** A scheduled job runs post-week. Queries Gateway for all relevant transactions, reconstructs the supplied balance timeline per user/account, calculates the TWA USD supplied for the week, checks minimums, and stores this final TWA value.
2.  **Stage 2 (Points Allocation):** Runs after Stage 1 completes. Aggregates the stored TWA values per user, calculates network total, and distributes the points pool proportionally.

**Decision (for this option):** Adopt the **two-stage weekly batch TWA calculation approach**. Stage 1 calculates and stores the final TWA per user for the week; Stage 2 aggregates and allocates.

#### Stage 1: Processing Flow (Scheduled BullMQ Job - Batch TWA Calculation)

_(Triggered periodically after a week ends)_

1.  **Initialization & Data Fetching:**

    - Receive job: `{ activityId, weekId }` (activityId = 3.1).
    - Fetch `Activity` rules (3.1), `Week` details (dates, ledger range).
    - Fetch list of participating `userIds` and their linked `accountAddresses`.
    - Fetch end-of-week USD prices for XRD/LSUs (Oracle/Cache).

2.  **Process Each User:**

    - For **each participating `userId`**:
      a. **Fetch Start Balance:** Get start-of-week supplied balances for XRD/LSUs across recognized protocols for all linked accounts of this user.
      b. **Gateway Query for User's Transactions:** Query Gateway `/stream/transactions` for the `weekId` ledger range. **Filter** by `affected_global_entities_filter`: [list of user's accountAddresses] AND potentially `affected_global_entities_filter`: [list of recognized_protocols]. Fetch all pages.
      c. **Reconstruct Timeline:** Process fetched transactions chronologically. Identify Lend/Withdraw events involving XRD/LSUs at recognized protocols for this user's accounts. Update the supplied balance timeline.
      d. **Calculate TWA:** Calculate TWA balances for XRD/LSUs based on the timeline.
      e. **Calculate User TWA USD:** `user_twa_usd_supplied = (TWA_XRD * price_XRD) + sum(TWA_LSUs * price_LSUs)`.
      f. **Minimum Value Check:** If `user_twa_usd_supplied < min_lent_value`, set `user_twa_usd_supplied = 0`.
      g. **Store Intermediate Result:** Store the calculated `user_twa_usd_supplied` (could be 0) in an intermediate table (e.g., `UserWeeklyActivityTWA`), linked to `userId`, `activityId` (3.1), and `weekId`. **Ensure idempotency** (e.g., `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`).

    ```sql
    -- Example: UserWeeklyActivityTWA Table
    CREATE TABLE UserWeeklyActivityTWA (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
      userId VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL REFERENCES Users(id),
      activityId UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES Activity(id),
      weekId UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES Week(id),
      twaUsdValue DECIMAL(36, 18) NOT NULL,
      calculatedAt TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
      UNIQUE (userId, activityId, weekId) -- Idempotency
    );
    ```

3.  **Job Finalization (Batch):**
    - Log completion (users processed, total TWA calculated). Acknowledge job.

#### Stage 2: Processing Flow (BullMQ Job - Weekly Points Allocation)

_(Triggered after the Stage 1 Batch Job for the week successfully completes)_

1.  **Initialization & Data Fetching:**

    - Receive job: `{ activityId, weekId }` (activityId = 3.1).
    - Fetch `ActivityWeek` record for `pointsPool`.

2.  **Aggregate Network TWA:**

    - Query `UserWeeklyActivityTWA` table for the activity/week.
    - Sum all positive `twaUsdValue` across all users -> `total_network_twa_supplied`.

3.  **Calculate & Allocate Points:**

    - If `total_network_twa_supplied > 0` and `pointsPool > 0`:
      - For each user record `{ userId, twaUsdValue }` where `twaUsdValue > 0`:
        - `account_points = (twaUsdValue / total_network_twa_supplied) * pointsPool`.
        - Store `account_points` temporarily per `userId`.
    - Else, no points allocated.

4.  **Store Final Points in UserWeeklyPoints:**

    - For each `userId` with points:
      - Find/create `UserWeeklyPoints` record (`userId`, `weekId`).
      - **Atomically** update `activityPoints` JSON: `{ ..., 3.1: account_points, ... }`.
      - **Atomically** increment `basePoints` by `account_points`.

5.  **Job Finalization & Cleanup:**
    - Log success. Optionally cleanup `UserWeeklyActivityTWA` records. Acknowledge job completion.

#### Dependencies (Batch)

- Snapshot mechanism/query for start-of-week supplied balances
- BullMQ Client/Worker
- Radix Gateway SDK Client
- Price Oracle Client
- Database Client
- **Job Scheduler**

#### Database Interactions (Batch - Stage 1)

- **Read:** `Activity`, `Week`, `UserAccount`, Start-of-week balance data
- **Write/Update:** Intermediate storage (`UserWeeklyActivityTWA`) - Idempotent.

#### Database Interactions (Batch - Stage 2)

- **Read:** `ActivityWeek`, Intermediate storage (`UserWeeklyActivityTWA`)
- **Read/Write/Update:** `UserWeeklyPoints` (Atomic updates)
- **Delete:** Intermediate storage (`UserWeeklyActivityTWA` - optional cleanup)

#### Error Handling (Batch)

- Stage 1: Handle Gateway query errors, pagination failures, TWA calculation errors, missing start balances. Ensure job reruns are safe (idempotency).
- Stage 2: Handle aggregation failures, zero total TWA, atomic update errors. Implement retries.

#### Considerations (Batch)

- **Latency:** Points finalized only post-week.
- **Start-of-Week Balance:** Crucial dependency.
- **Resource Spikes:** Concentrated load during batch runs.
- **Complexity:** TWA calculation within the batch job is complex.

---

**Next Step:** Decide between Option 1 and Option 2. The choice likely depends on the chosen approach for holding activities (1.1, 1.2) and the existence of a reliable start-of-week balance snapshot mechanism.
