## How to track Astrolescent transactions:

Any tx that includes our fee component component_rdx1cpxvjgh5a0mewtzkx7j8gzpq0dh676gq5t4hh3svjm02xwakmxa6l7 in the affected_global_entities_filter is a swap via Astrlescent. The fee component is also present in the manifest.

For example: https://www.radxplorer.com/components/component_rdx1cpxvjgh5a0mewtzkx7j8gzpq0dh676gq5t4hh3svjm02xwakmxa6l7?tab=transactions
