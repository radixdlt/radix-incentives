# üîê User Authentication Flow with Radix Connect

## User Story

As a user, I want a secure and intuitive authentication flow using Radix Connect so that I can safely access my dashboard while maintaining control of my wallet information.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The system prompts for Radix Connect authentication when users try to access protected dashboard areas
- Users receive clear instructions on how to complete the authentication process through their Radix Wallet
- The system generates and validates challenge strings through ROLA (Radix Off-Ledger Authentication) to verify wallet ownership
- Users can authenticate multiple accounts through a single session with proper verification for each
- The system maintains secure session management with appropriate timeout and refresh mechanisms
- Users receive clear error messages if authentication fails, with guidance on troubleshooting
- The authentication state persists appropriately across browser sessions based on user preferences
- Users can manually log out to terminate their authenticated session when desired
- The authentication flow is responsive and works properly on both desktop and mobile devices

## Notes

This authentication flow should follow the official Radix Connect implementation guidelines and ensure a seamless user experience while maintaining high security standards. The authentication should be the entry point to the entire dashboard experience, enabling all other user stories to function properly once the user is authenticated.

## Technical Considerations

- Integrate with Radix-dApp-toolkit for wallet connection handling
- Implement secure challenge/response flow for ROLA
- Create a dedicated API endpoint to generate challenge strings for the ROLA proof
- Store generated challenges securely with appropriate expiration times
- Design session management that balances security with usability
- Ensure proper error handling for all potential authentication failure scenarios
